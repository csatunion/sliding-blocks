The development of a natural language processing (NLP) applications often
requires human data. In particular, corpora of human language use in
the target domain are an essential resource for designing, training,
and evaluating NLP systems, and task based evaluations give the most
realistic feedback on how actual users will interact with the
system. Both corpus production and task based evaluations are
expensive and time-consuming, with one major factor being the
recruiting of participants.

Recently, a number of projects have used online games to recruit
people to help with the collection and annotation of corpora and the
task-based evaluation of NLP applications.

  M-turk work?; GIVE

\item problems with GIVE: not fun, not a game

This paper describes a puzzle game in which two players collaborate to
push one or more balls into a goal position. The players are in two
different 2D-environments, but they can drop blocks into the other
environment, which are necessary to direct the ball. Furthermore,
there are portals which allow the balls to pass back and forth between
the environments. The players may or may not be able to see their
partner's environment, but they can communicate using a chat
interface.

The game was designed to ellicit a mixed-initiative, task-oriented
conversation in which both players alternate between the roles of
instruction giver and instruction follower. We are particularly
interested in the situated language use and how actions in the game
environment contribute to the dialog.  By manipulating whether or not
the players can see each other's environment, we want to compare the
effects of a more directly shared workspace with a situation in which
the players receive only very indirect information about their
partner's workspace (through the locations at which blocks are
dropped). Finally, we want the game to be fun. \todo{Why?}
