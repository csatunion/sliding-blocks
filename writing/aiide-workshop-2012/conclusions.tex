\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

This paper has described a collaborative two-player puzzle game which
we have designed as a tool for collecting human-human problem-solving
dialogs in a situated scenario. We have implemented a prototype and
are currently designing and playtesting more levels. Once we have
created a set of levels of varying difficulty, we will start
collecting human-human interactions, first in the lab at Union College
and then by making it available online.

The motivation for this research is to learn more about communication
in situated environments where language and actions get interleaved.
We plan to use the collected data to inform the adaptation of existing
natural language generation algorithms to situated dialog.  To
validate our results, we plan to implement them in a conversational
system that can take the role of one of the players in this game. The
framework described in this paper can then be used to evaluate the
system over the Internet.
