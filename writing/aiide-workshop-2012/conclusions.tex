\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

\begin{itemize}
\item currently: playtests to design levels
\item collect a corpus of interactions: first in the lab at Union
  College, then make available online (scalability?), first to Union College
  community, then more broadly
\item study human-human situated communication
\item computational model to replace one of the players by a
  dialog/NLG system
\item goal: learn about effective strategies in situated communication
  and develop mechanisms for implementing them that can be transferred
  to other virtual environments and tasks
\end{itemize}
