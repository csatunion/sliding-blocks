\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

This paper has described a collaborative two-player puzzle game which
we have designed as a tool for collecting human-human problem-solving
dialogs in a situated scenario. We have implemented a prototype and
are currently designing and playtesting more levels. Once we have
created a set of levels of varying difficulty, we will start
collecting human-human interactions, first in the lab at Union College
and then by making it available online.
We plan to use the collected data to develop a conversational system
that can play this game and to evaluate it over the Internet.

The motivation for this research is to learn more about communication
in situated environments where language and actions get interleaved
and to develop algorithms for effective communication strategies that
can be implemented in dialog systems and transfer to other virtual
environments and tasks.
