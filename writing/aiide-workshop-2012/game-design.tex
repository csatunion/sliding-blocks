\section{Game Design}

\todo{adapt to player A/B; mention background image}

Our goal in designing this game is to elicit problem solving
dialogues between two players who are situated in a virtual
environment. We want both players to equally contribute to the dialog
as well as the problem solving process.  Ultimately, we want to build
dialog systems that can take the role of one of the players. That
means that the environment has to be simple enough that we can use
automated planning techniques to calculate strategies for solving the
puzzles.

In this two-player game, each player is situated in a maze created
from obstacles and traps of various kinds.  Figure
\ref{fig:player-screenshots} illustrates what the game interface may
look like for each player at some point in the
game\footnote{While the game is fully playable, the interface is still
  a prototype in which everything is represented by differently
  colored blocks.}. The red block is player one's avatar, the green
block player two's avatar. The purple block is the ball, which needs
to be pushed to the goal represented by the orange block. The 
gray blocks are portals. Portals come in pairs -- if the ball or
player enter one portal, they exit through another one --- and connect
different areas of one player's environment or link one player's
environment with the other's. The light gray portals are open to both the
ball and the player; the dark gray portals can only be used by the ball.


% what players do; moving the ball

The players can move their avatars using the arrow keys on their
keyboard. When they push the ball, it starts moving in the direction
of the push and only stops when it collides with an obstacle (see
Figure \ref{fig:pushing-against-wall}(a)). If the
ball cannot move in the direction of the push (e.g. because there is
an obstacle), it (randomly) picks a direction that is free of
obstacles to move to, as illustrated in Figures
\ref{fig:pushing-against-wall}(b) and (c). This behavior makes sure
that the ball only gets trapped if it is surrounded by walls on three
sides (Figure \ref{fig:pushing-against-wall}(d)).

% placing of blocks

Pressing the Ctrl-key allows players to place an obstacle
into their partner's environment at the position that corresponds to
the player's current location. Each player can only place three blocks
on their partner's screen at a time. When the fourth block is placed,
the block that was placed first is deleted, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:dropping-blocks}.

\caption{Each player can place at most three obstacles at a time. When
  the fourth obstacle gets placed, the first one disappears.}
\label{fig:dropping-blocks}
\end{figure}

% chatting 
The players cannot place obstacles into their own environments, and
since obstacles are the only way to stop a ball that is moving, they
have to collaborate to control the balls movements. 
The environments are designed to force the players to work together
and communicate with each other.  The players can use a chat area next
to their game environment to coordinate their strategy and to give
instructions on where obstacles need to be placed.


% visibility of screens

We are creating three modes of the game by manipulating whether the
players can see their partner's environment, in order to study the
effect that additional shared information about the context has on
communication.  In the first mode, the players don't see their
partner's environment (as in Figure \ref{fig:player-screenshots}), but
the locations of the obstacles that get dropped into their environment give
them some hints where their partner is. In mode two, the players can
see a shadow of their partner's avatar moving around their own
environment, so that they always know where their partner is, but they
don't have any information about the layout of their partner's
environment. And in the third mode, the players see their
own environment and their partner's side by side.


% kinds of obstacles 

The game starts out with relatively simple environments, but gets more
complicated as additional kinds of obstacles and traps and more
complex variations of the task get introduced.  For example, there may
be pits which can swallow the ball (or player), bouncy obstacles which
reflect the ball when it hits them, moving fireballs which burn and
kill the ball or player, destructible barriers which the partner can
explode by dropping an obstacle onto them, or forking portals which
send the ball/player randomly to one of two exits.  At some point in
the game, each player is given their own set of one or more balls. This
will allow for some interesting variations on the task. For example,
there may be multiple goal positions and the players have to navigate
their balls to corresponding goals. Or the balls are numbered
(e.g. player one has balls number 1, 3 and 4 and player two has balls
2 and 5) and the balls have to be push into goals in order. Or the
balls have colors and both players have to move a ball of the same
color to a goal before they can work on the next ball with a different
color.
