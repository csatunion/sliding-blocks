\begin{abstract}
\begin{quote}
This paper describes a prototype of a two-player collaborative 2D
puzzle game, designed to elicit task-oriented situated dialog. In this
game players use a text-based chat to coordinate their actions in
pushing a ball through a maze of obstacles. The game will be used to
collect corpora of human-human interactions in this environment. The
data will be used to study how language with actions are interleaved
and influence each other in situated dialog. The ultimate goal is to
build a computational model of these behaviors.
