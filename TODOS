Hallo


- Add info about database schema to README.
DONE- Make possible to run without database connection.
DONE players input id in order to map questionnaire to player
DONE redesign database -> need a session id; way of tying starting phase
     log entries, tutorial phase log entries and game phase log entries
     together
DONE add connection time to player table
DONE second player's (playerid 6) session id was not recorded
     correctly (seems to work after all)
DONE when other player disconnects, gameid needs to be set to -1 again??
- more generall: Check what happens at disconnect
DONE a way to synchronize timing?
DONE take copyrighted pics out of repository
[- ip reminder only needs to be sent once --> too much work;
   experimenter can take care of it]

DONE adjust replayer to knew db format
DONE change visual of wall blocks
- game is trying to draw hints even if there are none for that level:
