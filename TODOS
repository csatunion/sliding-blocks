- hints need to be drawn on the top layer/in the foreground (so that
  they don't get covered by the wall)


- Add info about database schema to README.

- more generall: Check what happens at disconnect

[- ip reminder only needs to be sent once --> too much work;
   experimenter can take care of it]

- game is trying to draw hints even if there are none for that level:
