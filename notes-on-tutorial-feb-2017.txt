- Test in both Firefox and Chrome.

Menu page:
- Firefox: game area overlaps text input area --fixed
- Buttons cut off some of the writing.		--fixed


Instructions 1:
- Needed: Videos with new block designs.


Individual:
- The speech bubbles are behind the wall.

- Firefox: animation of portal seems not smooth.


Instructions 2:
- Needed: Images/videos with new block designs.

- Second slide - Firefox: White area should have some padding so that
  text doesn't go all the way to the edge.

- Fourth slide - Firefox: fix linespacing? The text is stretched over
  a lot of space vertically. The images are pushed to the very bottom.

- Sixth slides (teleporter): The text is not quite accurate. It says
  that there will be a teleporter on "your screen and one on your
  partner's screen", but actually the teleporter may just be on one
  screen, so that the ball can be transported from one world to the
  other but not back.

  It says to press the full screen button to see how the teleporter
  works, but the video works fine without making it full screen. Maybe
  change to indicate that making it full screen is optional. People
  can make the video full screen (full screen button in the bottom
  left corner of the video) if they want to see it bigger.


Two-player tutorial:
- Speech bubbles behind walls.

- Levels 1 and 2: Better if ball does not automatically go into goal
  once it went through the portal? If it stops 

- server error when finishing the two-player tutorial


Actual game:
- Player passage is hard to see. Make colored? Thicker lines?

- Here, too. I ran into a server error when one of the players
  refreshed. (Not sure why. Will have to look into it.)
